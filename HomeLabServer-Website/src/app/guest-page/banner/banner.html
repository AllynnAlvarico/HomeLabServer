          This site is my homelab project, I built this totally out of curiosity as a third-year business computing
          student diving into the world of servers and infrastructure.
          I set this up so I could learn how to deploy <strong class="text-indigo-600">full-stack web app</strong>
          , from <strong class="text-indigo-600">frontend</strong> to <strong class="text-indigo-600">backend</strong>
          application and manage  <strong class="text-indigo-600">databases</strong>
          without any external limitations or restrictions.
          .

          This is a personal project and my own way to learn hands-on server management and full-stack development.
          If you’re into tech, check out what I’m experimenting with, <strong class="text-indigo-600">Ubuntu Server</strong>
          to automation with <strong class="text-indigo-600">bash</strong> and <strong class="text-indigo-600">n8n</strong>.
          I’m always learning new things and open to ideas or collabs!
